# karyoploteR - An R/Biocondutor package to plot arbitrary data along the genome

## Description

karyoploteR is an R package to plot data along the genome using a karyotype style plot. 
It is entirely based on R base graphics and inspired by the R base graphics API. 
It includes functions to plot primitive graphic elements such as points, lines,
rectangles, text, etc and higher level functions to plot a heatmap, the regions 
in a GenomicRanges object or the cumulative coverage of such regions.

Data positioning and track configuration has been inspired by Circos and does
not understands the concept of track. Thus, it is possible to freely specify 
where to plot the data and to create plots with multiple independent tracks or
overlapping representations.

It is highly configurable and in addition to the parametrizatiopn of the 
different data plotting functions, it is possible to specify custom functions 
for every plotting action from the basic chromosome bands to the chromosome labels
or base numbers.
